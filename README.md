# 401k Capital Flight

Inspired by the content in "Survival of the Richest: Escape Fantasies of the Tech Billionaires" by Douglas Rushkoff, I will be anazlyzing the options provided by TNReady, the 401k portal/provider for State of TN employees.

Based on the funds available, I will research what the underlying assets of the funds contain and where they are located. For location I will be using corporate HQ as that is where I will say the money is 'flowing' to. 

I expect the vast majority of money to flow out of Tennessee, meaning other regions are benefiting from our capital and capital flight out of the state is occurring.
